This is my personal implementation of Monad Oy's Noflight challenge. Outside sources are credited in-code if used.

This implementation does trigonometry and circular geometry to form nice routes between coordinate-direction pairs. There is no collision avoidance detection, as it would be a fair bit of work, to produce time-coordinate pairs for routes and splitting routes into 2 sub-routes when collision is detected.
